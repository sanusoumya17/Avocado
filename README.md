Avocado Prices

Historical data on avocado prices and sales volume in multiple US markets

Background:

Starting in 2013, the table reflects an expanded, multi-outlet retail data set. Multi-outlet reporting
includes an aggregation of the following channels: grocery, mass, club, drug, dollar and military. The
Average Price (of avocados) in the table reflects a per unit (per avocado) cost, even when multiple units
(avocados) are sold in bags. The Product Lookup codes (PLU’s) in the table are only for Hass avocados.
Other varieties of avocados (e.g. greenskins) are not included in this table.


Some relevant columns in the dataset:


• Date - The date of the observation

• AveragePrice - the average price of a single avocado

• type - conventional or organic
